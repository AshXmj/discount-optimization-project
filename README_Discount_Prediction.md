# Discount Effectiveness Prediction

## 📄 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the effectiveness of discounts in driving sales and optimizing profitability. By analyzing historical sales data, it aims to help businesses identify optimal discount strategies and select eligible customers or items for targeted discounts.

## 💡 Problem Statement
Offering discounts is a common tactic to increase sales, but excessive or poorly targeted discounts can reduce overall profitability. This project builds predictive models to analyze discount impact and guide better discount decisions.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source**: Internal sales report (`Sales reportcsv.csv`)
- **Key features**: 
  - Item prices
  - Discount percentages
  - Sales values
  - Profit margins
  - Other item or transaction attributes

## ⚙️ Methodology
- **Data preprocessing**: 
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature engineering on discount-related columns
- **Modeling**: 
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- **Evaluation metrics**: 
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² score

## 📊 Results
- Regression models were trained and evaluated to predict profit outcomes based on discount strategies.
- Feature importance analysis provided insights on which features influence profit the most.
- Visualizations demonstrated error distributions and model comparisons.

## ✅ Conclusion
The models offer a data-driven approach to estimate how discounts impact profitability, supporting strategic discount planning and customer targeting.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrating time-series sales forecasting
- Building an interactive dashboard for business users
- Including customer segmentation for personalized discounts
